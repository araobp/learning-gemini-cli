# Learning Gemini CLI: Web Application Generation

This repository serves as a practical testbed to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of the Gemini CLI in generating web applications. All code within this project has been entirely generated by the Gemini CLI, showcasing its potential for rapid application development and scaffolding.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to:
- Validate Gemini CLI's ability to understand and implement web application requirements.
- Evaluate the quality and structure of the generated code.
- Provide a tangible example of AI-assisted web development.

## Features (Generated by Gemini CLI)

Currently, this project includes a basic web application structure, demonstrating:
- A SvelteKit application setup.
- Essential configuration files (`package.json`, `svelte.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`, etc.).
- A simple Svelte page (`src/routes/+page.svelte`).

As the project evolves, more complex features and different web technologies may be explored and generated by the Gemini CLI.

## Getting Started

To run this Gemini-generated web application locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/learning-gemini-cli.git
    cd learning-gemini-cli/webapp
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `your-username` with the actual repository owner's username if you fork this project.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The application should now be accessible in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Gemini CLI's Role

Every line of code, every configuration file, and every dependency in this repository has been orchestrated and written by the Gemini CLI based on user prompts. This project stands as a testament to the power of large language models in automating and assisting software development workflows.

## Future Enhancements

Future iterations of this project may involve:
- Generating more complex UI components and pages.
- Integrating with backend services (also generated by Gemini CLI).
- Exploring different frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Vue) or backend technologies (e.g., Node.js, Python).
- Implementing testing frameworks and generating tests.

Stay tuned to see how Gemini CLI evolves in its web application generation capabilities!
